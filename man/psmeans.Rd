\title{ Function to take means of probesets. }
\description{
This is used to estimate expression levels of genes based on the measurements for the relevant probes.

}
\usage{
psmeans(eS, ind)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{eS}{ A transformed, normalized expression set. }
  \item{ind}{ A vector used to indicate which probes go into which probesets. }

}
\details{

The vector ind has form like c(1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,...)
Each entry corresponds to one probe and tells the number of the probeset it belongs to.

}
\value{
Returns an expression set with the same vlist as eS, but the matrix rows now correspond to probesets instead of individual probes.
